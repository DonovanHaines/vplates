Varisokan microplate data analysis tools.

These tools are a work in progress by the Haines Lab in the Department of Chemistry at Sam Houston State University. They allow a user to take Varioskan Flash microplate data exported to Excel and reformat them and do some custom plotting and analysis (it is hoped these tools will grow and expand with time).
